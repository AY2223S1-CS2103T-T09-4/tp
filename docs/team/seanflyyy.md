### Project: Teacher's Pet

Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find the next available class
  * What it does: outputs the next available class based on the specified time range and duration of class
  * Justification: This feature is an integral part of this application as without it, it will be really tedious 
  for the user to find an available class, and the schedule feature of the application will not be complete.
  * Highlights: Finding the next available class in the specified requirements is much faster than manually checking 
  each day until the user finds the slot he/she wants.

* **New Feature**: Added find by tag feature

* **New Feature**: Added find by next of kin phone feature
* 
* **New Feature**: Add Schedule List Panel and styled UI
