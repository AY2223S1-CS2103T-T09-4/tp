### Project: Teacher's Pet

Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Teacher’s Pet allows you to manage your schedule and keep track of your students. The app stores basic information about your students, such as Name, Contact Number, Class Date and more.

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Features Implemented**:
  * Mark a student command - A feature that allows the tutor to mark the student as present for a class.
  * Receive payment from a student command - A feature that allows the tutor to indicate that a student has paid.
  * Statistics window - A display window part of the application which shows basic statistics of the tutor's students.


* **Enhancement to existing features** -`Find` command:
  * What it does: `find` command now allows the tutor to search for details of the students based on their attributes (`Name`, `Phone`, `Next-of-Kin Phone`, `Email`, `Address`, `Class Date`, `Tags`)
  * Justification: As a `Person` has other attributes other than `Name`, the tutor might want to search by other attributes as well.
  * Areas contributed:
    * Constructed the skeletal code for group members to implement other attribute searches.
    * Find-by-name: A search system which allows the tutor to search up details of the student by his/her name.
    * Find-by-phone: A search system which allows the tutor to search up details of the student by his/her phone number.


* **Code contributed**: ~2.2kLoC.
